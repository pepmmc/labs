# labs
attempt to upload labwork
in this folder are the furthest attempts at labwork.

I notice that with each new section, we learn something that could be useful for the prior section, 
so I am intending to go back and refine some of the earlier labs, once all is finished the first time.

The biggest difficulty I had so far was with passing private variables across types (lab3).

I know it has to do with get set, but i have to refine my practical or applied understanding of that concept;

i am intending to go back to 3 first, once 5 (and exam?) are finished.
